      React is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for
      building user interfaces. It’s ‘V’ in MVC. ReactJS is an open-source,
      component-based front-end library responsible only for the view layer of
      the application. It is maintained by Facebook. React uses a declarative
      paradigm that makes it easier to reason about your application and aims to
      be both efficient and flexible. It designs simple views for each state in
      your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the
      right component when your data changes. The declarative view makes your
      code more predictable and easier to debug.
